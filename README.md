Comparing Accuracy of the Decision Tree Regression , Random Forest, and Multiple Linear Regression

You are hired by a venture capitalist to predict the profit of a startup. Fo that you have to deal with a dataset which contains the details of 50 startupâ€™s and predicts the profit of a new Startup based on certain features. Based on your decision and prediction, whether one should invest in a particular startup or not.

Dataset contains the following fields: R&D Stend - Total amount of money spent on Research and Development Administration - Total amount of money spent on Administration Marketing Spend - Total amount of money spent on Markeing State - The state where the startup operates Profit - Profit earned by startup

You have to perform following task before applying machine learning algorithms: 1) Handle missing values 2) Prepare data for training and testing 3) Apply Decision Tree algorithm to train the model 4) Apply Random Forest Regressor algorithm to train the model 5) Compare the accuracy with Linear Regression too.
